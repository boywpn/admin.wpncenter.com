## Impetus
I created this package in response to a client project that had complex, nested
forms with many `<select>`'s that resulted in over 700 database queries on one
page. I needed a package that abstracted the caching process out of the model
for me, and one that would let me cache custom queries, as well as cache model
relationships. This package is an attempt to address those requirements.

## Features
-   automatic, self-invalidating relationship (only eager-loading) caching.
-   automatic, self-invalidating model query caching.
-   automatic use of cache tags for cache providers that support them (will
    flush entire cache for providers that don't).

## Requirements
-   PHP >= 7.1.3
-   Laravel 5.4 - 5.7

### Possible Conflicting Packages
Any packages that also override `newEloquentModel()` from the `Model` class will
likely conflict with this package. So far these may include the following:

## Installation
```
composer require genealabs/laravel-model-caching
```

## Configuration
### Recommended (Optional) Custom Cache Store
If you would like to use a different cache store than the default one used by
your Laravel application, you may do so by setting the `MODEL_CACHE_STORE`
environment variable in your `.env` file to the name of a cache store configured
in `config/cache.php` (you can define any custom cache store based on your
specific needs there). For example:
```
MODEL_CACHE_STORE=redis2
```

## Usage
For best performance a taggable cache provider is recommended (redis,
memcached). While this is optional, using a non-taggable cache provider will
mean that the entire cache is cleared each time a model is created, saved,
updated, or deleted.

For ease of maintenance, I would recommend adding a `BaseModel` model that
uses `Cachable`, from which all your other models are extended. If you
don't want to do that, simply extend your models directly from `CachedModel`.

Here's an example `BaseModel` class:

```php
<?php namespace App;

use GeneaLabs\LaravelModelCaching\Traits\Cachable;

abstract class BaseModel
{
    use Cachable;
    //
}
```
### Multiple Database Connections
__Thanks to @dtvmedia for suggestion this feature. This is actually a more robust
solution than cache-prefixes.__

Keeping keys separate for multiple database connections is automatically handled.
This is especially important for multi-tenant applications, and of course any
application using multiple database connections.

### Optional Cache Key Prefix
Thanks to @lucian-dragomir for suggesting this feature! You can use cache key
prefixing to keep cache entries separate for multi-tenant applications. For this
it is recommended to add the Cachable trait to a base model, then set the cache
key prefix config value there.

**Note that the config setting is included before the parent method is called,
so that the setting is available in the parent as well. If you are developing a
multi-tenant application, see the note above.**

Here's is an example:
```php
<?php namespace GeneaLabs\LaravelModelCaching\Tests\Fixtures;

use GeneaLabs\LaravelModelCaching\Traits\Cachable;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\BelongsTo;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\BelongsToMany;

class BaseModel extends Model
{
    use Cachable;

    public function __construct($attributes = [])
    {
        config(['laravel-model-caching.cache-prefix' => 'test-prefix']);

        parent::__construct($attributes);
    }
}
```

### Exception: User Model
I would not recommend caching the user model, as it is a special case, since it
extends `Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User`. Overriding that would break functionality.
Not only that, but it probably isn't a good idea to cache the user model anyway,
since you always want to pull the most up-to-date info on it.

### Experimental: Cache Cool-down In Specific Models
In some instances, you may want to add a cache invalidation cool-down period.
For example you might have a busy site where comments are submitted at a high
rate, and you don't want every comment submission to invalidate the cache. While
I don't necessarily recommend this, you might experiment it's effectiveness.

It can be implemented like so:
```php
(new Comment)
    ->withCacheCooldownSeconds(30)
    ->get();
```

### Disabling Caching of Queries
There are two methods by which model-caching can be disabled:
1. Use `->disableCache()` in a query-by-query instance.
2. Set `MODEL_CACHE_DISABLED=TRUE` in your `.env` file.

**Recommendation: use option #1 in all your seeder queries to avoid pulling in
cached information when reseeding multiple times.**
You can disable a given query by using `disableCache()` anywhere in the query chain. For example:
```php
$results = $myModel->disableCache()->where('field', $value)->get();
```

### Manual Flushing of Specific Model
You can flush the cache of a specific model using the following artisan command:
```sh
php artisan modelCache:clear --model=App\Model
```

This comes in handy when manually making updates to the database. You could also
trigger this after making updates to the database from sources outside your
Laravel app.

## Possible Future Improvements
- [caching of lazy-loaded relationships, see #127](https://github.com/GeneaLabs/laravel-model-caching/issues/127).
- [caching of global scopes, see #106](https://github.com/GeneaLabs/laravel-model-caching/issues/106).

## Summary
**That's all you need to do. All model queries and relationships are now
cached!**

In testing this has optimized performance on some pages up to 900%! Most often
you should see somewhere around 100% performance increase.

## Commitment to Quality
During package development I try as best as possible to embrace good design and development practices, to help ensure that this package is as good as it can
be. My checklist for package development includes:

-   ✅ Achieve as close to 100% code coverage as possible using unit tests.
-   ✅ Eliminate any issues identified by SensioLabs Insight and Scrutinizer.
-   ✅ Be fully PSR1, PSR2, and PSR4 compliant.
-   ✅ Include comprehensive documentation in README.md.
-   ✅ Provide an up-to-date CHANGELOG.md which adheres to the format outlined
    at <http://keepachangelog.com>.
-   ✅ Have no PHPMD or PHPCS warnings throughout all code.

## ❤️ Open-Source Software - Give ⭐️
We have included the awesome `symfony/thanks` composer package as a dev
dependency. Let your OS package maintainers know you appreciate them by starring
the packages you use. Simply run composer thanks after installing this package.
(And not to worry, since it's a dev-dependency it won't be installed in your
live environment.)
